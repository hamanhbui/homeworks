\section{Tree embeddings with total cost (Exercise 8.12) (33 points)}

We saw in class that given a metric space $(V, d)$, the FRT tree embedding algorithm is a randomized algorithm that generates a tree metric $(V', T)$ such that 1) $V' \supseteq V$, 2) $d(u,v) \leq d_T(u,v)$ for all $u,v \in V$ and $T$ in the support of the algorithm, and 3) $\expct{d_T(u,v)} \leq O(\log n) \cdot d(u,v)$ for all $u,v \in V$ (where the expectation is taken over the randomized choice of $T$).  Note that this is for the distribution over trees generated by FRT -- any individual tree might distort some distance quite badly.  But sometimes we will want a bound on a single tree, so we might ask for something else: a single tree in which the \emph{total cost} is small.

Suppose that we are given a metric space $(V,d)$ and costs $c : {V \choose 2} \rightarrow R^+$ (where costs have nothing to do with distances, and ${V \choose 2}$ denotes all unordered pairs of nodes in $V$).  Give a polynomial-time randomized algorithm that returns a tree metric $(V', T)$ for $V$ (so $V$ is the leaves of $T$) such that: 
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
\item $d(u,v) \leq d_T(u,v)$ for all $u,v \in V$ with probability $1$, and 
\item  $\sum_{u,v \in V} c(u,v) d_T(u,v) \leq O(\log n)  \sum_{u,v \in V} c(u,v) d(u,v)$ with very high probability (at least $1 - \frac{1}{2^n}$).  
\end{enumerate}

Hint: Try to \emph{use} FRT rather than \emph{modifying} it.

\textcolor{purple}{
    Reusing the result from the class, we know that the FRT gives a polynomial-time randomized algorithm s.t. with probability $1$, for all $u,v \in V$,
    \begin{align}\label{eq:1}
        \begin{cases} 
            d(u,v) \leq d_T(u,v)\\ 
            \mathbb{E}\left[d_T(u,v)\right] \leq \mathcal{O}(\log n) d(u,v).
        \end{cases}
    \end{align}
    Therefore, we get
    \begin{align}\label{eq:2}
        \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{u,v \in V} c(u,v) d_T(u,v)\right] &= \sum_{u,v \in V} \mathbb{E}\left[c(u,v) d_T(u,v)\right]\nonumber\\
        &\leq \mathcal{O}(\log n)  \sum_{u,v \in V} c(u,v) d(u,v) \text{ (by Eq.~\ref{eq:1})}.
    \end{align}
    Since this inequality holds over the random choices of the trees from the randomized algorithm, there must exist some tree $T$ generated by the algorithm such that the inequality holds. So, let's sample using FRT to select the optimal tree $T$, we know that $\sum_{u,v \in V} c(u,v) d_T(u,v)$ is a nonnegative random variable and $\mathcal{O}(\log n)  \sum_{u,v \in V} c(u,v) d(u,v)>0$, hence, using Markovâ€™s inequality, we obtain
    \begin{align}\label{eq:3}
        p\left(\sum_{u,v \in V} c(u,v) d_T(u,v) \geq \mathcal{O}(\log n)  \sum_{u,v \in V} c(u,v) d(u,v)\right) &\leq \frac{\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{u,v \in V} c(u,v) d_T(u,v)\right]}{\mathcal{O}(\log n)  \sum_{u,v \in V} c(u,v) d(u,v)}.
    \end{align}
    Consider $B(u,r)$ be the ball around $u$ of radius $r$, by FRT, on level $i$, $w$ cut $(u,v)$, $u\in B(w,r_i)$ and $v\notin B(w,r_i)$, we know that $r_i$ is chosen uniformly at random from $[2^{i-1},2^{i})$, since $r_0$ is chosen uniformly at random from $\left[\frac{1}{2},1\right)$, charge the cost $c$ to the cut, by Eq.~\ref{eq:2} and $c : {V \choose 2} \rightarrow R^+$, we get
    \begin{align}
        \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{u,v \in V} c(u,v) d_T(u,v)\right]\leq \frac{1}{2^n} \mathcal{O}(\log n)  \sum_{u,v \in V} c(u,v) d(u,v),        
    \end{align}
    plugging into Eq.~\ref{eq:3}, we obtain
    \begin{align}
        p\left(\sum_{u,v \in V} c(u,v) d_T(u,v) \geq \mathcal{O}(\log n)  \sum_{u,v \in V} c(u,v) d(u,v)\right) \leq \frac{\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{u,v \in V} c(u,v) d_T(u,v)\right]}{\mathcal{O}(\log n)  \sum_{u,v \in V} c(u,v) d(u,v)} \leq \frac{1}{2^n},
    \end{align}
    i.e., $\sum_{u,v \in V} c(u,v) d_T(u,v) \leq \mathcal{O}(\log n)  \sum_{u,v \in V} c(u,v) d(u,v)$ with at least $1 - \frac{1}{2^n}$.\\

\section{Capacitated Dial-a-Ride (Exercise 8.11) (67 points)}
In the Capacitated Dial-a-Ride problem, we are given a metric $(V, d)$, a single vehicle with a given integer capacity $C > 0$ located at a given node $r \in V$, and $k$ source-sink pairs $(s_1, t_1), \dots, (s_k, t_k)$.  At each source $s_i$ there is an item which must be delivered to the sink $t_i$ by the vehicle. The vehicle can carry at most $C$ items at a time.  The goal is to find the shortest tour that starts and ends at the $r$, delivers each item from its source to its destination without exceeding the vehicle capacity, and returns to $r$.  Note that such a tour may visit a node of $V$ multiple times.  We assume that the vehicle is allowed to temporarily leave items at any node in $V$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item (34 points) Suppose that $(V, d)$ is actually a tree metric $(V, T)$ (so $T$ is a tree with vertex set $V$, not just with leaves $V$).  Give an $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for this case.  

Hint:  for each $i \in [k]$ there is a unique path $p(i)$ in $T$ from $s_i$ to $t_i$.  First show that without loss of generality, you can restrict your attention to the subtree induced by $r$ and the source-sink pairs.  For each edge $e$ which remains, let $\ell(e)$ denote the number of these paths which use edge $e$.  Prove that OPT needs to traverse $e$ at least $\max(1,\ell(e) / C)$ times.  Design an algorithm which traverses each edge at most $O(1) \cdot \max(1,\ell(e) / C)$ times.  

\item (33 points) Give a randomized $O(\log n)$-approximation for the general Capacitated Dial-a-Ride problem, where $n = |V|$.  Please do this formally -- it's not enough to say ``FRT embeds with distortion $O(\log n)$, so we lose an $O(\log n)$ factor".  Hint: you might want to use the steiner point removal result discussed in the lecture notes and (briefly) discussed in class.

\end{enumerate}

\textcolor{purple}{
    (a) For each $i \in [k]$, there is a unique path $p(i)$ in $T$ from $s_i$ to $t_i$. Let the turning point of $i$ be the highest node in the tree on the path $p(i)$. Let $v$ be the turning point of $i$. The path $p(i)$ first moves upwards from $s_i$ to $v$, and then downwards from $v$ to $t_i$.\\
    Consider vertices lie on a path $p(i)$ for some item $i$. Let $T'$ be the Steiner tree spanning all these vertices and node $r$. Then, we know that any tour that starts and ends at $r$, that performs all the pickups and deliveries must visit all these vertices and $r$. Thus any tour must traverse every edge in $T'$ at least $2$ times. Therefore, without loss of generality, we can restrict our attention to the subtree $T'$, and edges not in $T'$ are discarded.\\
    For each edge $e$ that remains, let $\ell(e)$ denote the number of paths that use edge $e$. Let decompose $\ell(e)=\ell_u(e) + \ell_d(e)$, where $\ell_u(e)$ and $\ell_d(e)$ are the number of paths that pass upwards and downwards through the edge $e$ respectively. Since the vehicle can carry at most $C$ items at a time, any tour that performs all the pickups and deliveries must traverse the edge $e$ at least $2\max(\left\lceil\ell_u(e)/C\right\rceil,\left\lceil\ell_d(e)/C\right\rceil)$, yielding the OPT needs to traverse $e$ at least $\max(1,\ell(e) / C)$ times. Therefore, we get a polynomial-time algorithm by performing two depth-first traversal steps as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Up-sweep: Starting from $r$, each item $i$ is moved up from its source to its turning point. We perform the depth-first traversal by recursively ensuring that after the subtree rooted at $e$ is explored, all $\ell_u(e)$ items that need to move up the edge $e$ are collected at the lower-end point of $e$. We then traverse the edge $e$ back and forth carrying at most $C$ items at a time and moving all these items up the edge $e$. Since we can temporarily leave items at any node, we get an edge $e$ is traversed $2\max\left(1,\left\lceil\ell_u(e)/C\right\rceil\right)$ times.
        \item Down-sweep: Each item $i$ is moved down from its turning points to its destination, then ending at $r$. We perform the depth-first traversal by recursively ensuring that before the subtree rooted at $e$ is explored, all $\ell_d(e)$ items that need to move down the edge $e$ are collected at the upper-end point of $e$. We then traverse the edge $e$ back and forth carrying at most $C$ items at a time and moving all these items down the edge $e$. Since we can temporarily leave items at any node, we get an edge $e$ is traversed $2\max\left(1,\left\lceil\ell_d(e)/C\right\rceil\right)$ times.
    \end{itemize}
    Using the up-sweep and the down-sweep results, the total number of traversals of edge $e$ is at most $O(1) \cdot \max(1,\ell(e) / C)$ times. Hence, the tour produced by the algorithm is at most $O(1)$ times the length of an optimal tour OPT, i.e., we obtain an $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for this case.
}

\textcolor{purple}{
    (b) Convert metric $(V,d)$ into an instance $(V,T)$ on the weighted tree $T$ s.t. $r$, sources and destinations of all items are at the leaves of the tree. We know that if $(V',T')$ is a tree embedding for $T$ which is a hierarchical cut decomposition, then we can find some other $T$ s.t. $d_{T'}(u,v)\leq d_T(u,v)\leq 4d_{T'}(u,v)$ for all $(u,v)\in V$. Let  $OPT$ be the cost of the optimal solution to $(V,d)$ and $OPT'$ is the cost of the optimal solution to $(V,T)$. By FRT, since $\mathbb{E}\left[d_{T'}(u,v)\right] \leq \mathcal{O}(\log n) d(u,v)$, so we have $\mathbb{E}\left[d_T(u,v)\right] \leq \mathcal{O}(\log n) d(u,v)$, hence, we obtain
    \begin{align}
        \mathbb{E}[OPT']\leq \mathcal{O}(\log n) \cdot OPT.
    \end{align}
    On the other hand, by FRT, we also know $d(u,v)\leq d_{T'}(u,v)$ for all $(u,v)\in V$, therefore, for all $(u,v)\in V$, we obtain
    \begin{align}
        d(u,v)\leq d_{T'}(u,v)\leq d_T(u,v)\leq 4d_{T'}(u,v) \leq 4d_{T}(u,v).
    \end{align}
    Hence, a solution $S'$ to $(V,T)$ can be converted to a solution $S$ of $(V,d)$ s.t. $cost(S)\leq cost(S')$. Therefore, since we have a $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for $(V,T)$ by (a), this gives us an $O(\log n)$-approximation for the general instances.
